## Why Chroma?

Chroma was built specifically for logos, fonts, and other vector designs that value precision. 

This app works like pixel art â€“ place "pixels" of any shape on a grid to create accurate and beautiful designs without worrying about measuring, alignment, etc.

## Features
- Built specifically for logos, fonts, and other precise designs
- Basic tools like draw, erase, fill, select, etc.
- Layers with opacity, blend modes, and effects like blur and drop shadow
- Photoshop-like history, undo, and redo, so you can try things out without committing
- Non-destructive erasing with positive and negative shapes
- See your designs tiled on multiple axes, great for creating seamless patterns
- Shortcuts for everything
- In-app documentation for advanced features and shortcuts
- Dark & light mode and other visual customization
- Export to SVG or PNG
- Saves to a `.Chroma` extension, but it's just JSON â€“ you can edit it yourself in any text editor
- Built natively for Apple products in Swift, for great performance

## Tech
- Built using Swift & SwiftUI
- Open source
